  about: `I am a senior Computer Science student at Brooklyn College with a current internship at Con Edison as part of their co-op program. Through this experience, I have gained valuable insights into practical applications of technology. My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation, including Modern Programming, Data Structures, Discrete Math, Intro to Java, and Applied Software Development. These courses have not only equipped me with essential technical skills but also ignited my passion for harnessing technology to solve real-world problems. As I embark on the journey of becoming a software engineer, I am eagerly seeking an internship opportunity that will allow me to further develop and refine my skills across various disciplines within the field.`,
